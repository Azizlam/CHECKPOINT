      Sports activities bring many benefits to the body. Practicing daily physical 
      exercise can extend life expectancy, not to mention the immediate 
      effect of sport, which releases endorphins in the body and provides a feeling of well-being. In addition to health, the motivations 
      that lead us to enroll in a sports club are multiple and can evolve as we become involved in training programs: fitness, weight gain, weight loss, 
      endurance, rehabilitation...<br/> <br/>THE INSTALLATIONS
